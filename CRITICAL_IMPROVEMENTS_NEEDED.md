# Critical Improvements Needed for Glimpse Production Deployment

## 1. Missing Critical Service Implementations

### 1.1 SMS Service (Partial Implementation)
**File:** `/server/src/services/SMSService.ts`
**Status:** Only development mode implemented, production SMS providers missing
**Required:**
- Twilio SMS integration (sendSMSViaTwilio method)
- Korean SMS providers integration (Aligo, NHN Cloud)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting for SMS sending

### 1.2 Payment Retry Logic
**File:** `/server/src/services/PaymentService.ts`
**Status:** Basic payment processing without retry mechanism
**Required:**
- Exponential backoff retry for failed payments
- Webhook failure handling and retry
- Payment reconciliation logic
- Idempotency key implementation

### 1.3 Email Service (Basic Implementation)
**File:** `/server/src/services/EmailService.ts`
**Status:** Basic nodemailer setup
**Required:**
- Production email provider integration (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Email template management
- Bounce handling
- Email queue with retry logic

## 2. Missing Test Coverage

### 2.1 Services Without Tests
The following critical services have NO test coverage:
- `FirebaseService` - Push notifications
- `SMSService` - Phone verification
- `OCRService` - Document verification
- `EmailService` - Email notifications
- `CompanyVerificationService` - Company verification flow
- `LocationService` - GPS-based features
- `NotificationService` - Notification management
- `CronService` - Scheduled tasks
- `FileUploadService` - File handling
- `EncryptionService` - Security-critical
- `StoryService` - Story management
- `CacheService` - Performance-critical
- `AdminService` - Admin functionality

### 2.2 Missing E2E Test Coverage
Critical user flows without E2E tests:
- Complete registration flow (SMS verification → Profile setup → Company verification)
- Payment flow (Credit purchase, Premium subscription)
- Matching flow (Like → Match → Chat initiation)
- Group creation and management
- Location-based group joining
- Story upload and viewing
- Premium feature access

## 3. Docker & Deployment Improvements

### 3.1 Dockerfile Improvements Needed
**Current Issues:**
- No multi-stage build optimization for dependencies
- Missing environment variable validation
- No cache layer optimization
- Basic health check implementation

**Required Improvements:**
```dockerfile
# Add dependency caching layer
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Add environment validation
RUN test -n "$NODE_ENV" || (echo "NODE_ENV not set" && exit 1)

# Optimize health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=40s --retries=5 \
  CMD node healthcheck.js
```

### 3.2 Missing Docker Compose Production Config
Need production-ready docker-compose with:
- Redis for caching and sessions
- PostgreSQL with proper configuration
- Nginx reverse proxy
- SSL/TLS termination
- Volume management for uploads
- Log aggregation

## 4. Critical TODO Items in Code

### 4.1 Authentication & Security
- `/mobile/screens/StoryUploadScreen.tsx`: Line 140 - Get token from Clerk
- `/mobile/services/locationService.ts`: Multiple locations - Clerk token implementation
- `/server/src/services/AdminService.ts`: Line 40 - Admin permission check logic

### 4.2 API Integration
- `/mobile/store/slices/locationSlice.ts`: Lines 33, 49, 71, 86 - Replace dummy data with API calls
- `/mobile/screens/WhoLikesYouScreen.tsx`: Line 36 - Replace dummy data with API
- `/mobile/store/slices/likeSlice.ts`: Line 152 - Implement actual API endpoint

### 4.3 Payment & Subscription
- `/server/src/services/UserService.ts`: Line 299 - Process actual payment with Stripe/Korean services

## 5. Production-Critical Missing Features

### 5.1 Monitoring & Observability
**Missing:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- APM integration (New Relic, DataDog)
- Custom metrics for business KPIs
- Error tracking beyond basic Sentry
- Real-time alerting system

### 5.2 Security Enhancements
**Missing:**
- Rate limiting per user/IP (only global rate limiting exists)
- CSRF protection
- Security headers middleware
- API key rotation mechanism
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### 5.3 Performance Optimizations
**Missing:**
- Database connection pooling configuration
- Redis caching strategy implementation
- CDN integration for static assets
- Image optimization pipeline
- API response compression

### 5.4 Business Logic Gaps
**Missing:**
- Subscription renewal logic
- Payment failure recovery flow
- User data export (GDPR compliance)
- Soft delete implementation
- Data retention policies

## 6. Infrastructure Requirements

### 6.1 Environment Variables Not Configured
Critical missing environment variables:
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `ALIGO_API_KEY`, `ALIGO_USER_ID`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` or `AWS_SES_*`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `TOSS_SECRET_KEY`, `KAKAO_PAY_ADMIN_KEY`
- `REDIS_URL` for production
- `SENTRY_DSN` for error tracking

### 6.2 Database Migrations
- Need migration strategy for production
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Data seeding for initial deployment

## 7. Immediate Action Items (Priority Order)

1. **Implement SMS Service** - Critical for user registration
2. **Add Payment Retry Logic** - Critical for revenue
3. **Create Service Tests** - At least for critical services (Auth, Payment, SMS)
4. **Setup Production Docker Compose** - For deployment
5. **Implement Environment Validation** - Fail fast on missing config
6. **Add E2E Tests** - For critical user journeys
7. **Configure Monitoring** - Before go-live

## 8. Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** SMS service, payment retry, critical service tests
- **Week 3:** Docker improvements, environment setup
- **Week 4:** E2E tests, monitoring setup
- **Week 5:** Security enhancements, performance optimizations
- **Week 6:** Final testing, documentation, deployment preparation

## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation but needs these critical improvements before production deployment. Focus on:
1. Completing SMS/Email service implementations
2. Adding retry logic for payments
3. Comprehensive testing (unit + E2E)
4. Production-ready Docker configuration
5. Monitoring and observability setup

These improvements are essential for a reliable, scalable production deployment of the Glimpse dating app.
